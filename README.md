This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.0.0.

## Development server
## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the project locally:

```bash
npm install
ng serve
```
Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.


## 🧑‍🏫 Educational Context

A company wants to store information about its contacts.  
To do so, it requires a **directory application** to manage its **suppliers** and **clients**.

The application must allow:
- Contact management (clients & suppliers)
- Contact search functionality
- Adding new contacts via a form
- Visual distinction between clients and suppliers through styling

## ✅ Evaluation Criteria

- The application is built using **Angular 20**
- All necessary components were created
- Data is simulated using **in-memory variables** (optionally from a **JSON file**)
- Angular **services** are used for data access
- **Styling** differs based on contact type (client or supplier)
- Each contact is displayed as a **card** showing:
  - A photo
  - Contact information
- A **contact detail view** is implemented
- A **search bar** is available
- A functional **add contact form** is included
